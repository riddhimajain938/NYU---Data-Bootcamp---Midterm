How do macroeconomic variables—specifically interest rates, inflation, unemployment, and housing prices—shape the performance of real-estate-related stocks, and how can analyzing shifts in monetary policy and economic conditions reveal periods of opportunity or vulnerability for investment and expansion?

This project examines how macroeconomic variables, specifically interest rates, inflation, unemployment, and housing prices shape the performance of real-estate related stocks. The goal of the analysis is to evaluate how shifts in monetary policy and economic conditions influence real estate market performance and to identify periods of opportunity or vulnerability for investment and expansion. Data was collected from multiple sources, stock prices from Yahoo Finance, macroeconomic indicators from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), and housing market data from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). Together, these datasets reveal how financial markets and the real economy interact across different phases of the economic cycle.
